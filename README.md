# Tutorial Project newcoder.io

# Data Visualization
#
# Through completing this tutorial I learned to make commits and publish to github using the command line. I also learned about parsing
# csv data into a format which could be processed and made into matplotlib plots.
# The tutorial parses San Francisco 2003 crime data from a sample csv file, produces matplotlib plots, along with a GeoJSON map.

# The origin of the python scripts parse.py, graph.py, and map.py are not my own.
